# Python for Everybody Specialization - Learning Exercises

This repository contains all my exercises and projects completed as part of the **Python for Everybody Specialization** by Dr. Charles Severance on Coursera.  

So far, I have completed the following courses:  
1. **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**  
2. **Python Data Structures**

These courses strengthened my Python fundamentals and hands-on data manipulation skills.

## 📂 Key Topics Covered
- Python basics, syntax, and control structures
- Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples
- String and text file manipulation
- Practical programs for organizing and analyzing unstructured data
- Python methods like `split()`, `sort()`, `get()`, `items()`, `startswith()`, and more
